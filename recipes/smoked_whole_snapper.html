        <h1>Description</h1>

        <p>Who isn’t impressed with a smoked whole fish? This snapper is easy, too. Pull together a few ingredients and let the smoker do the rest of the work. Garnish with lime wedges to serve.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>2 (1 pound) whole snapper, cleaned and scaled</li>
            <li>3 limes, sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning (such as TDon's Cajun Goods®)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the smoker to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Pat fish dry; cut 3 small slits on each side of fish and stuff with lime slices. In a small bowl combine olive oil, Cajun seasoning, garlic, and parley. Coat fish with mixture.</li>
            <li>Smoke fish until it flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes. An instant read thermometer, inserted near the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Garnish with lime wedges to serve.</li>
        </ol>
